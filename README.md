# 👋 Hi, I'm Noah – aka TheRealKlobow

💻 Self-taught developer and currently in training as an agricultural machinery mechanic.

I build tools, bots and admin panels for fun – and one day, I want to turn it into a business.

## 🚧 Projects I'm working on

- **❄️ Snow Clearing Admin Panel**  
  Web-based tracking system with Leaflet.js and Node.js backend. Built for local use and management.

- **🎣 Discord Fishing Database Bot**  
  Built with image upload, weight/length registration, and auto-embeds. Custom-built for Danish sport fishing communities.

- **🚗 GTA V Mod Installer**  
  Custom C# installer with an HTML/CSS UI (via CEFSharp), made to install modpacks with 1 click – clean and user-friendly.

- **🛠️ Utility Scripts & Tools**  
  I also build smaller projects for fun or custom use – always with a clean UI and focused functionality.
