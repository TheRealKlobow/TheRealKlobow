# 👋 Hi, I'm Noah – aka TheRealKlobow

Founder & developer behind **KLB Groups**.  
Self-taught full-stack developer from Denmark, currently in vocational training – building real production systems alongside.

I focus on **modular API systems, admin platforms, and scalable web products**.  
Long-term goal: build and grow sustainable software products under KLB Groups.

## 🚀 KLB Groups

🌐 https://klbgroups.com  

KLB Groups is my umbrella brand for building and operating structured software platforms, APIs, and internal tools.

Core focus areas:
- Modular backend systems
- Centralized APIs
- Admin & control panels
- Scalable architecture from day one

---

## 🧠 Core Platforms

### 🧩 KLB API (V2)
A modular API system acting as the backbone across products.

- Versioned API architecture
- Module-based structure (core + feature modules)
- Auth, roles, logging, health checks
- Designed for long-term scaling and maintenance
- Used across multiple internal products

The API is built to be boring, predictable, and reliable – exactly how infrastructure should be.

### 🎓 TeacherTool
🌐 https://teachertool.dk  

A platform built for teachers and schools.

- Admin panels for school management
- User & role handling
- Class and structure-based tooling
- Focus on usability and real classroom needs
- Actively developed and iterated

TeacherTool is a real product, not a demo – built with feedback, structure, and long-term vision.

## 🛠️ What I actually work with

**Backend & Infrastructure**
- PHP (modular API architecture)
- Node.js (services, hubs, workers)
- Auth, sessions, tokens
- Health checks, logging, backups

**Frontend & Admin Panels**
- Clean, functional admin UIs
- Focus on clarity over flashy design
- Internal tools that scale with complexity

**Ops & Platform Thinking**
- Cloudflare (DNS, tunnels, access)
- Environment separation (dev / prod)
- Backups & recovery (learned the hard way 😅)
- Structure before features

---

## 👀 Looking for

- Serious collaborations
- Platform-level freelance work
- Feedback from people building real systems
- Long-term opportunities around software products

Not interested in quick scripts or throwaway projects.
