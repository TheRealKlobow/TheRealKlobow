## 🚀 What I Do

I build structured operating environments and controlled deployment systems.

Not trend-based SaaS.  
Not frontend clones.  
Real systems that boot, validate, and run.

## 🧩 Active Systems

### 🐾 ClawOS

ClawOS is a prebuilt ARM-based operating system designed to run OpenClaw with minimal setup.

Instead of manually installing Linux, enabling SSH, installing Node, fixing permissions and services - you just flash and boot.

ClawOS includes:

- 🔐 SSH enabled on first boot
- 👤 Preconfigured sudo-capable system user
- 🟢 Node 22+ enforced at build time
- 🤖 OpenClaw CLI pre-installed and validated
- 🧪 Service validation before packaging
- 🔁 CI-controlled image releases
- 📀 Deterministic ARM image builds

Target hardware:
- 🍓 Raspberry Pi
- 📡 ARM edge devices
- 🖥 Self-hosted AI nodes

Goal:

Flash → Boot → Connect → Run OpenClaw

No dependency chaos.  
No broken first boot.  
No manual setup frustration.

ClawOS removes friction from running https://openclaw.ai/ on ARM hardware.
